# AI Pet Projects

Welcome to my collection of AI-related pet projects! ðŸš€  
This repository is a hub where I explore different aspects of AI by building various small-scale projects. Each folder inside this repo contains a standalone project focused on a unique use case of AI, from text generation to image processing.

## Projects Included

### 1. **CaptionCraft**
A web-based application that generates Instagram captions using Google's Generative AI. Upload an image, provide a creative prompt, and get AI-generated captions that are concise, poetic, and emotionally impactful.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Streamlit, Google Generative AI, Pillow
- **Use Case**: Instagram caption generation with images
